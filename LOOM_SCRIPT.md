Hi, I'm Sagar Kashyap. This video walks through my submission for Better Software ASE assessment.

1) Overview (10s) — what you will see: backend APIs, frontend UI and PRs.
2) Backend (40s) — show routes in backend/routes.py, explain models, show tests running with pytest.
3) Frontend (50s) — open frontend, demonstrate adding, editing, deleting tasks and comments. Explain axios calls to /api.
4) Decisions (20s) — mention SQLite, proxy, folder structure, trade-offs.
5) Closing (10s) — mention PR links and invite questions.

Total: ~2 minutes
